# 99_Bottles_of_Beer
This is a repo for the Alexa Skill, 99 Bottles of Beer, that is available on the Alexa Skills Store

Available at: https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07D6VQMTD?ie=UTF8&ref-suffix=ss_rw

Install on your Alexa device with "Alexa, enable skill 99 Bottles of Beer"

Play it with "Alexa, play 99 Bottles of Beer"

To respond with text for Alexa to speak, the response needs to be fewer than 8,000 characters. As such, I condensed the song by removing one repeated line of "# bottles of beer on the wall" and removed the word "of" from one line of the chorus after the first 10 verses play.
